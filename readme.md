#python-challenge
In this Challenge, I was  tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a 
company and election results for a county.

I used several concepts learned in class as well as the help from tutors, David Pecot, and Kourt Bailey, as well as several pages on stackoverflow.com and 
the python documentation to resolve all asked


The Main Script to run for each analysis is save in its respective folder under "main.py".

The code resulted in a text file of which the outputs are named in the appropriate folders.
